# Hi, I'm Abhishek ðŸ‘‹

20+ years building resilient systems that don't break when things go wrong. I help engineering teams move faster while keeping production stable, secure, and actually reliable.

Currently leading Chaos Engineering for a major financial services firm, teaching systems to fail gracefully before customers notice.

**Want to know more about my career journey?** Chat with my [AI Alter Ego](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AbhishekDatta/AbhishekDatta-Career-Journey) - it responds exactly like I would, trained on my complete professional background and available 24/7.

## What I Do

**Chaos Engineering**  
Breaking things on purpose so they don't break by accident. Reduced high severity incidents by 30% and medium/low incidents by 70% through Game Days and controlled failure injection.

**Site Reliability Engineering**  
Keeping production running when everyone else is asleep. Built monitoring, automation, and incident response systems that cut MTTD by 37% and MTTR by 28%.

**Cloud & Infrastructure**  
13 years deep in AWS, managing everything from a few servers to massive distributed systems. Saved companies $9M+ through smart automation and resource optimization.

**DevOps & Platform Engineering**  
Built CI/CD pipelines that took deployment time from days to minutes. Made developers 3x more productive by removing friction and automating the boring stuff.

**AI in Operations**  
Applying Generative AI, LLMs, and Agentic AI to make incident response smarter and faster. Building chatbots that actually help instead of just looking cool.

**Leadership**  
Mentored teams from 4 to 50+ engineers across the US, India, China, and Australia. I believe in teaching people to solve problems, not just following runbooks.

## Real Results

- **Uptime**: Maintained five 9's availability (99.999%) for financial services applications handling billions in transactions
- **Speed**: Cut release cycle time by 50-80% through Kubernetes, Terraform, and smart automation
- **Cost**: Delivered $10.83M in savings across Expedia and Arcesium through intelligent tooling and cloud optimization
- **Resilience**: Achieved 100% compliance to RTO/RPO in disaster recovery drills quarter after quarter
- **Security**: Zero security incidents across multiple organizations by baking security into developer workflows (SAST, DAST, SCA)
- **Incidents**: Reduced production downtime by 20-50% through proactive monitoring and chaos engineering

**AI/ML**: AWS Bedrock, Sagemaker, building LLM powered tools for SRE

## What I Write About

I share what I learn on [Medium](https://medium.com/@AbhishekDatta22), focusing on Chaos Engineering, SRE practices, Generative AI applications in reliability engineering, and making systems more resilient:

## Where I've Worked

**Morgan Stanley** (via Capgemini) - Senior Manager, Chaos Engineering  
Leading global team driving resilience across wealth management platforms

**RingCentral** - Director, DevOps & SRE  
Built the foundation for their India market launch, won Best Debut and Best Team awards

**Arcesium** - Associate Director, Platform SRE  
Implemented chaos engineering, disaster recovery, and error budget frameworks for hedge fund systems

**Expedia Group** - Senior Manager  
Led global SRE teams, built automation that won hackathons and saved millions

Plus earlier roles at Guavus, HCL, and startups where I learned how to keep things running with duct tape and determination.

## What I'm Looking For

I love working with teams that care about both speed and reliability. If you're building systems that need to stay up when it matters, let's talk.

Open to discussing:
- Chaos Engineering leadership roles
- SRE/Platform Engineering positions (Staff+ level)
- DevOps leadership with focus on reliability
- Advisory or consulting on resilience engineering
